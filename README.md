# Hypatia - LEO Satellite Network Simulation Framework

## Overview
Hypatia is a comprehensive Python-based simulation framework designed for modeling and analyzing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such as Kuiper, Starlink, and Telesat. This framework enables researchers to simulate satellite network states, communication links, and evaluate network performance under realistic conditions.

## Key Features
- Simulation of satellite states and communication links (Ground-to-Satellite and Inter-Satellite links)
- Support for multiple constellation models including Kuiper, Starlink, and Telesat
- Integration with ns-3 simulator for network simulation and data analysis
- Tools for satellite constellation state generation and visualization

## System Requirements
- Linux operating system (Ubuntu 18.04 or later recommended)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- ns-3 network simulator with required dependencies
- Additional Python packages: numpy, exputil, matplotlib, and others (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypatia.git
